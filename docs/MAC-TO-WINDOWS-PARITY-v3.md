# macOS → Windows parity — the 2026-09 editor & recording work

**What this is.** The macOS app (this repo, `main`) gained features in September 2026 that the
Windows port does not have. This document tells whoever ports them **exactly** what was built —
layout, items, labels, behaviour, defaults, persisted data, and pure logic — so the Windows version
can match without reading Swift. It is the reverse of `docs/WINDOWS-TO-MAC-PARITY.md`.

**The Windows port.** C#/.NET 9 + WPF on the `windows-port` branch, under `windows/`. Start with
`windows/README-win.md`, `windows/docs/PROGRESS.md`, and the per-module ground-truth files
`windows/docs/port-reference/0N-*.md`. Its recording engine is **ffmpeg** (`ddagrab`/`gdigrab` video,
WASAPI loopback system audio, `dshow` microphone) with pause implemented as one ffmpeg segment per
active span, concatenated at the end (`windows/src/BetterScreenshot.App/Recording/RecordingEngine.cs`).

**Conventions.** Sizes are macOS points; treat 1 pt = 1 WPF device-independent pixel. "SF Symbol"
names are macOS icon names — map them to the port's icon set in
`windows/src/BetterScreenshot.App/Resources/Icons.xaml`. Quoted UI strings are verbatim and should be
copied exactly. The design rationale for Parts 0–6 is in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-betterscreenshot-editor-recording-v3-design.md`.

**Each section below covers:** Layout (exact) · Items & behaviour · Data (persisted keys, defaults,
legacy decoding) · Pure logic to port 1:1 (with the macOS test cases) · Where it goes in the port ·
Platform notes (where Windows must differ).

## A. Already built on macOS, 2026-09-24 (commits `d845ad1`, `4a4316c`, `88f3a8f`)

_(pending — written by the coordinating session)_

---

## Part 0 — Trim window: Cancel restores the Quick Access card

_(pending — filled when Part 0 lands)_

---

## Part 1 — Editor side panel, hint line, zoom, tool shortcuts, opacity

**What changed, in one paragraph.** The annotation editor's one-row "inspector pill" under the toolbar
is gone. Its options now live in a **264pt dark side panel on the right** (the *inspector*) with titled
sections that change with the active tool and the selection. A one-sentence **hint line** above the
bottom action bar explains the active tool. The canvas can be **zoomed** (Fit … 800%). Every tool has a
**single-key shortcut**. Every object has an **opacity**. The Colour section keeps the last 6 custom
colours (**Recent**) and has an **eyedropper**. Any style change now applies to the **selected
object(s)** — not only to new objects — as one undo step. macOS code: `Packages/EditorKit/Sources/EditorKit/`
(`EditorWindowController.swift`, `EditorInspectorView.swift`, `InspectorModel.swift`, `EditorZoom.swift`,
`ZoomMath.swift`, `RecentColors.swift`, `EditorTool.swift`, `EditorChrome.swift`, `Annotation.swift`).

Snapshots from the headless probe (synthetic screenshot, Retina): `docs/parity-v3/part1-arrow-tool.png`

**Window.** Title "Annotate", transparent title bar. Minimum size **884 × 440** while the panel is shown
(600 canvas column + 8 gap + 264 panel + 12 margin), **600 × 440** while it is hidden. Initial content size:
`width = min(max(imageW' + 48, 600) + 264 + 20, screenW − 40)`, `height = min(max(imageH' + 112 + 84, 520),
screenH − 60)`, where `imageW' = min(image px width, 1200)` and `imageH'` keeps the aspect ratio; screen =
the main screen's visible area. Backdrop behind the canvas: white 12% (dark mode) / white 90% (light).

**Tool pill** (unchanged look): top 12pt from the content top, **centred over the canvas column** (not the
window). Dark HUD (`NSVisualEffectView` `.hudWindow`, vibrant dark), corner radius 15, 1px border white 10%,
6pt padding. Buttons 38×38, SF Symbol 16pt medium, 3pt apart; selected = accent-colour rounded rect
(radius 9, inset 2), hover = white 13%. Groups separated by 1×22pt lines (white 13%):
`[Select] | [Arrow, Line, Rectangle, Filled Rectangle, Ellipse] | [Text, Counter] | [Blur, Pixelate] | [Crop]`.
Tooltips are now **"<Name> (<Key>)"**, e.g. "Arrow (A)", "Filled Rectangle (F)" (the Text tooltip's long
instruction moved to the hint line).

| Tool | SF Symbol | Port icon (`Icons.xaml`) | Key | Tooltip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Select | `cursorarrow` | `icon-cursor` | V | Select (V) |
| Arrow | `arrow.up.right` | `icon-arrow` | A | Arrow (A) |
| Line | `line.diagonal` | `icon-line` | L | Line (L) |
| Rectangle | `rectangle` | `icon-rect` | R | Rectangle (R) |
| Filled Rectangle | `rectangle.fill` | `icon-rect-fill` | F | Filled Rectangle (F) |
| Ellipse | `circle` | `icon-ellipse` | O | Ellipse (O) |
| Text | `textformat` | `icon-text` | T | Text (T) |
| Counter | `1.circle.fill` | `icon-counter` | N | Counter (N) |
| Blur | `drop.fill` | `icon-blur` | B | Blur (B) |
| Pixelate | `square.grid.3x3.fill` | `icon-pixelate` | P | Pixelate (P) |
| Crop | `crop` | `icon-crop` | C | Crop (C) |

(Part 3 will add Highlighter = H and Spotlight = S.)

**Canvas column.** A scroll view from 6pt below the tool pill down to the bottom bar, from the window's left
edge to 8pt left of the panel (to the window's right edge when the panel is hidden). Content insets
top 20 / left 24 / bottom 24 / right 24. The canvas is centred when smaller than the visible area.

**Side panel** (`EditorInspectorView`). 264pt wide; top 12pt below the content top, 12pt from the right
edge, bottom 12pt above the bottom bar. Same HUD look as the pill: `.hudWindow`, vibrant dark, corner
radius **12**, 1px border white 10%.
- **Heading:** 13pt semibold, white 92%, 14pt from the top, 16pt from the left; single line, truncates.
  Text: the tool name (table above); under Select: **"Nothing selected"**, the object's tool name
  ("Text", "Arrow"…), or **"N objects"** (e.g. "2 objects").
- **Sections** start 10pt below the heading, inside a vertical scroll area (overlay scroller, flashed once
  when the sections don't fit — e.g. Text at the minimum window height). Each section: padding 12 top /
  16 sides / 14 bottom, 8pt between rows, content width **232pt**. Caption = the section title in
  UPPERCASE, 10pt semibold, white 45%. Sections are separated by a 1px line (white 10%) inset 16pt each side.
- Row labels: 12pt regular, white 88%. Value readouts: 11.5pt monospaced digits, white 55%, right-aligned,
  40pt wide. Controls use the small control size (≈22pt tall); slider rows are 24pt tall.

Section contents (top to bottom, only the sections listed in §1.2 appear):

| Section (caption) | Rows (exact) |
|---|---|
| **Colour** | ① 8 preset swatches spread evenly across 232pt: Red `#FF453B` (1.00, 0.27, 0.23), Orange (1.00, 0.62, 0.04), Yellow (1.00, 0.84, 0.04), Green (0.19, 0.82, 0.35), Blue (0.04, 0.52, 1.00), Purple (0.75, 0.35, 0.95), White, Black — sRGB; each 22×22 hit area with a 16pt circle, 1px white-22% outline, tooltip = colour name; the current colour gets a 2px white ring. ② "RECENT" caption (48pt wide) + up to 6 swatches 6pt apart, tooltip "Recent colour"; row hidden when there are none. ③ Colour well 44×24 (tooltip "Custom colour — opens the colour picker") + small rounded button **"Pick from Screen"** with SF `eyedropper` (tooltip "Eyedropper — click anywhere on screen to use that colour"). |
| **Stroke** | ① "Width" label (44pt) · slider 1…24 (whole px) · value "4 px". ② Segmented **Thin / Medium / Thick** = 2 / 4 / 7 px (tooltips "2 px", "4 px", "7 px"), equal widths, full row; no segment highlighted when the width is another value. |
| **Font** (Text) | ① Font pop-up, full width (tooltip "Font"): System, Rounded, Serif, Mono (each drawn in its own face), separator, every installed family. ② Size pop-up 84pt wide (tooltip "Font size"): 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 64, 96 "pt" (+ the current size if it's another value) · Bold/Italic toggle pair (SF `bold`, `italic`, 30pt segments, tooltips "Bold", "Italic"). ③ Alignment, full width, three equal segments (SF `text.alignleft`, `text.aligncenter`, `text.alignright`; tooltips "Align left", "Align centre", "Align right"). |
| **Background** (Text) | Checkbox **"Contrasting box behind the text"** (tooltip "A dark or light box, whichever stands out against the text colour") = today's auto-contrast chip, `textBackground`. *Part 2 replaces this section with None / Solid / Auto + colour, padding, radius.* |
| **Redaction** (Blur/Pixelate tools) | Segmented **Blur / Pixelate**, full width (tooltips "Blur (B)", "Pixelate (P)"); switches the active tool. *Part 3 adds Strength here.* |
| **Opacity** | Slider 10…100 (no label) · value "100%" (tooltip "How see-through the object is"). |
| **Arrange** (Select with a selection) | Three equal small buttons, 6pt apart: **Front** (SF `square.3.layers.3d.top.filled`, port `icon-bring-front`, tooltip "Bring to front ( ] )"), **Back** (`square.3.layers.3d.bottom.filled`, `icon-send-back`, "Send to back ( [ )"), **Delete** (`trash`, `icon-trash`, "Delete (⌫)"). |
| *(note)* Crop | No caption. 12pt, white 62%: "Drag over the part of the image you want to keep. Undo (⌘Z) brings the rest back." |
| *(note)* Select, nothing selected | No caption: "Click an object on the image to change it here. Drag across empty space to select several." |

**Bottom bar** (84pt tall, standard header material, 1px separator line on top).
- **Hint line:** 10pt below the top, 16pt from the left: SF `info.circle` (12pt, tertiary label colour) +
  6pt + the sentence (12pt, secondary label colour, truncates at the right).
- **Action row:** 12pt above the bottom. Left (18pt in): image size "1600 × 1000 px" (11.5pt monospaced,
  secondary). Right (16pt in), 8pt apart: **zoom pull-down** (small) · 12pt · vertical separator (18pt) ·
  10pt · **Done** (borderless, secondary text, ⌘W) · **Stack** (SF `square.stack`, tooltip "Keep in the
  bottom-right stack") · **Save** (SF `square.and.arrow.down`, ⌘S) · **Copy** (accent-filled, white text,
  SF `doc.on.doc`, ⇧⌘C). Copy stays the rightmost, primary button.

**Title bar, right side:** Undo (SF `arrow.uturn.backward`, tooltip "Undo (⌘Z)"), Redo
(`arrow.uturn.forward`, "Redo (⇧⌘Z)"), 10pt gap, **panel toggle** (SF `sidebar.right`, an on/off button,
tooltip "Hide Inspector (⌥⌘I)" when shown / "Show Inspector (⌥⌘I)" when hidden). Buttons 26×22, borderless.

### 1.2 Which sections show (pure `InspectorModel` — port 1:1)

Objects are described by **the tool that draws them** (arrow → Arrow, text → Text, …).

| Active tool | Selection | Heading | Sections |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arrow, Line, Rectangle, Ellipse | (any) | tool name | Colour · Stroke · Opacity |
| Filled Rectangle, Counter | (any) | tool name | Colour · Opacity |
| Text | (any) | Text | Colour · Font · Background · Opacity |
| Blur, Pixelate | (any) | tool name | Redaction |
| Crop | (any) | Crop | Crop note |
| Select | none | Nothing selected | Select note |
| Select | one object | its tool name | that object's sections (rows above; Blur/Pixelate objects have none) + **Arrange** |
| Select | several | "N objects" | only the sections **every** selected object has, in panel order, + **Arrange** |

Panel order is always: Colour, Stroke, Font, Background, Redaction, Opacity, Arrange.
Under a drawing tool the selection is the object just drawn with it, so its sections are the tool's.

### 1.3 Hint line — verbatim strings

| When | Sentence |
|---|---|
| Typing in a text (any tool) | Type your text — ↩ or Esc finishes it, ⇧↩ starts a new line. |
| Select, nothing selected | Click an object to select it, or drag across empty space to select several. |
| Select, one text | Drag to move it, drag a side handle to set the box width, or double-click to edit the text. |
| Select, one rectangle / filled rectangle / ellipse / blur / pixelate | Drag to move it, drag a handle to resize it, or press Delete to remove it. |
| Select, one arrow / line / counter | Drag to move it, or press Delete to remove it. |
| Select, several | Drag to move them together, or press Delete to remove them. |
| Arrow | Drag to draw an arrow — it points to where you let go. |
| Line | Drag to draw a straight line. |
| Rectangle | Drag to draw a rectangle outline. |
| Filled Rectangle | Drag to draw a solid rectangle that covers what's under it. |
| Ellipse | Drag to draw an ellipse. |
| Text | Click to type a label, drag to make a text box, or click existing text to edit it. |
| Counter | Click to place the next numbered step. |
| Blur | Drag over anything you want to hide — it's blurred when you let go. |
| Pixelate | Drag over anything you want to hide — it's pixelated when you let go. |
| Crop | Drag over the area to keep — everything outside is cut away (⌘Z undoes it). |

On Windows write Ctrl+Z for ⌘Z and Shift+Enter / Enter for ⇧↩ / ↩.

### 1.4 Behaviour

- **Style edits.** Every panel change is one *edit* of one field (e.g. "line width = 7"). It is applied to
  (a) the **default style** for new objects — which is also the persisted sticky default — and (b) **every
  selected object**, as **one undo step**. With nothing selected only the default changes (no undo step).
  A slider drag and one colour-picker session each merge into a single undo step (the step ends when the
  slider is released, the selection changes, or anything else changes the document). While a text is being
  typed the edit restyles the live text instead (committed with the text as one step).
- **Values shown** = the selection's style (the back-most selected object's) when something is selected,
  otherwise the default style.
- **Selection vs tools.** Choosing a drawing tool (button or key) **clears the selection** and commits any
  text being typed; choosing Select **keeps** it. A just-drawn object stays selected, so the panel restyles
  it right away. **Change:** a Counter click now selects the new badge too (it used to leave nothing selected).
- **Esc:** with a drawing tool → Select tool; with Select → clears the selection. (While typing text, Esc
  finishes the text as before.)
- **Tool keys** (table in §1.1) are single keys with no modifiers, case-insensitive, and do nothing while
  a text is being typed (the keys type into the text instead).
- **Opacity** 10–100% for every object except Blur/Pixelate (no Opacity section there). An object is drawn
  as **one layer** at that opacity, so where its own parts overlap (arrow shaft cap under the head, text
  over its background box) the tint does not double up. The live text editor shows the same opacity.
- **Recent colours:** only *custom* colours are recorded — colours set with the colour well or the
  eyedropper (the 8 presets are always visible). Newest first, no duplicates (equal at 8-bit precision),
  max 6. Clicking a Recent swatch applies it and moves it to the front. One colour-picker drag session adds
  **one** entry (each new colour from the same session replaces the front entry). Shared by all tools.
- **Eyedropper:** macOS `NSColorSampler` — a magnifier loupe; click anywhere on screen to take that colour
  (Esc cancels). The picked colour is applied and added to Recent.
- **Panel toggle:** title-bar button or ⌥⌘I. Hiding gives the canvas the full width (min width 600);
  showing it again grows the window to 884pt if it's narrower. The canvas re-fits. Not persisted.
- **Zoom** (`ZoomMath` + `CanvasZoomController`):
  - *Percent* is per **screen pixel**: 100% = one image pixel per physical screen pixel (on a 2× display
    that is 0.5pt per image pixel). The control shows **"Fit · 57%"** in Fit mode, else **"150%"**.
  - *Fit* (default; ⌘0) = the whole image inside the canvas column (minus the insets), but **never larger
    than 1pt per image pixel** (the editor's old display size for small captures). Fit re-fits whenever the
    window resizes, the panel toggles, or a crop/undo changes the image size.
  - Range: **min(Fit, 100%) … 800%**. ⌘+ (also ⌘=) / ⌘− step through **10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200,
    300, 400, 600, 800 %** (next stop above/below the current value). ⌘1 = 100%. Landing exactly on the Fit
    value switches back to Fit mode.
  - Trackpad **pinch** and **⌘ + scroll wheel** zoom continuously (pinch: ×(1 + magnification); wheel:
    ×e^(0.01·Δ), Δ = the precise scroll delta, or 12× the line delta for a notched mouse wheel ≈ 13% per
    notch), **anchored on the pointer**: the image point under the pointer stays under the pointer. Keys and
    the menu anchor on the centre of the visible area. Plain scrolling pans.
  - Zoom pull-down menu: "Zoom In ⌘+", "Zoom Out ⌘−", —, "Fit to Window ⌘0", "Actual Size (100%) ⌘1", —,
    "50%", "200%", "400%", "800%". Tooltip: "Zoom — pinch, ⌘-scroll, ⌘+ / ⌘−, ⌘0 fits, ⌘1 is 100%".
  - At ≥ 3 screen pixels per image pixel the image is drawn with nearest-neighbour sampling (crisp pixels).
  - Everything works at any zoom: drawing, hit-testing, 8pt resize handles (screen-sized, not image-sized),
    marquee, crop, and the live text editor (it moves and rescales with the zoom while you type).

### 1.5 Data

| Key / field | Type & default | Legacy rule |
|---|---|---|
| `AnnotationStyle.opacity` (JSON key `opacity`, inside the `editorDefaultStyle` blob) | number 0.1…1, default **1** | missing → 1; decoded values are clamped to 0.1…1 |
| `editorRecentColors` (UserDefaults, JSON array of `{"r","g","b","a"}` 0…1 sRGB) | newest first, ≤ 6, default `[]` | missing/corrupt → `[]` |

Port: add `public double Opacity { get; init; } = 1;` to `AnnotationStyle` in
`windows/src/BetterScreenshot.Editor/EditorStyle.cs` (System.Text.Json leaves the initializer value when the
property is missing; clamp in the setter or after load), and an `EditorRecentColors` list to the DTO in
`windows/src/BetterScreenshot.Platform/SettingsStore.cs` next to `EditorDefaultStyle`.

### 1.6 Pure logic to port 1:1 (with the macOS tests)

- **`InspectorModel`** (`InspectorModel.swift`) — `objectSections(for:)`, `toolSections(for:)`,
  `content(tool:selection:)` → heading + sections, `hint(tool:selection:editingText:)`; section titles and
  note texts. Tests (`Tests/EditorKitTests/InspectorModelTests.swift`): strokeToolsShowColourStrokeOpacity ·
  filledRectangleAndCounterShowColourOpacity · textShowsColourFontBackgroundOpacity · redactionAndCropTools ·
  drawingToolIgnoresItsSelectionForSections · selectWithNothingSelected · selectWithOneObjectShowsItsSectionsPlusArrange
  (text → Colour, Font, Background, Opacity, Arrange; blur → Arrange) · selectWithSeveralShowsSharedSectionsPlusArrange
  (arrow+text → Colour, Opacity, Arrange, heading "2 objects"; arrow+rectangle adds Stroke; arrow+pixelate → Arrange) ·
  sectionsKeepPanelOrder · hintsCoverEveryToolAndState.
- **`EditorTool` metadata** (`EditorTool.swift`) — display name, symbol, shortcut key, tooltip "Name (K)",
  `forShortcut` (single character, case-insensitive), `maker(of:)` (annotation → tool). Tests:
  toolShortcutsAreUniqueAndCaseInsensitive ("z" and "ab" → none; tooltips "Arrow (A)", "Filled Rectangle (F)") ·
  everyAnnotationTypeMapsToItsTool.
- **`RecentColors`** (`RecentColors.swift`) — `add(color, replacingFront:)`, `same(a, b)` at 8-bit precision,
  capacity 6; `init(list)` dedupes and keeps order. Test: recentColoursAreMostRecentFirstUniqueAndCapped.
- **`ZoomMath`** (`ZoomMath.swift`) — percent ↔ magnification, `fitMagnification`, `clamp`, `steppedPercent`,
  `isFit` (within 0.5%), `anchoredOrigin(anchor, visibleOrigin, from, to)` = `anchor·k − (anchor − origin)`,
  `k = new/old`, `label`. Tests (`zoomMathTests`): percentIsPerScreenPixel (m 0.5 @2× = 100%) ·
  fitCoversBothDimensionsAndNeverUpscalesPastOnePointPerPixel (2000×1000 in 1000² → 0.5; 1000×3000 in
  1000×600 → 0.2; 200×100 → 1) · clampRangeIsFitToEightHundred (@2×: 10 → 4, 0.1 → fit 0.3, fit 1 lets 0.5
  through) · stepsWalkTheStopTable (100→150, 57→75 / 50, 800 stays, 10 stays) ·
  anchoredZoomKeepsThePointUnderThePointer ((300,200) with origin (100,50), 1→2 → origin (400,250), and back) ·
  labels ("Fit · 57%", "150%").
- **Opacity** — tests (`OpacityTests.swift`): opacityDefaultsToOpaque · legacyStyleWithoutOpacityDecodesOpaque ·
  opacityRoundTripsAndClampsOnDecode (0 → 0.1) · halfOpacityFilledRectBlendsWithBase (red 50% on white →
  G,B ≈ 128) · translucentArrowDoesNotDoubleUpWhereShaftMeetsHead (12px arrow (20,50)→(80,50): pixel (51,50)
  equals the shaft's (35,50)) · canvasDrawsWithOpacityToo.
- **Style edits on the selection** — tests (`CanvasStyleEditTests.swift`): styleEditRestylesTheSelectionAsOneUndoStep ·
  groupedEditsMergeUntilTheGroupEnds · editWithNothingSelectedLeavesTheDocumentAlone ·
  selectionIsDescribedByTheToolsThatDrawIt.

### 1.7 Where it goes in the port

- `windows/src/BetterScreenshot.App/Editor/EditorWindow.xaml` — today a `DockPanel` with the toolbar +
  horizontal `Inspector` StackPanel on top, buttons at the bottom and a `Viewbox` canvas. Becomes: top band
  with the tool pill centred over the canvas column; a right-docked 264px panel; a bottom bar with the hint
  line and the action row (image size · zoom drop-down · Done/Stack/Save/Copy); the canvas in a
  `ScrollViewer` (the `Viewbox Stretch="Uniform"` can't zoom or scroll — size the `Stage` grid explicitly:
  image px × magnification, like the Mac canvas frame).
- `windows/src/BetterScreenshot.App/Editor/EditorWindow.xaml.cs` — `BuildInspector`/`RefreshInspector`/
  `SetColor`/`SetWeight`/`SetSize` move into a new panel `UserControl` (e.g. `Editor/EditorInspectorPanel.xaml`)
  driven by `InspectorModel`; `OnKeyDown` gains the tool keys, Esc and the zoom keys; `SelectTool` clears the
  selection for drawing tools; tool tooltips become "Name (K)".
- `windows/src/BetterScreenshot.Editor/` — new `InspectorModel.cs`, `ZoomMath.cs`, `RecentColors.cs`;
  `EditorTool.cs` gains name / key / `ForShortcut` / `MakerOf` helpers; `EditorStyle.cs` gains `Opacity`.
- `windows/src/BetterScreenshot.App/Editor/DocumentRenderer.cs` — wrap each annotation's drawing in
  `DrawingContext.PushOpacity(style.Opacity)` … `Pop()` (WPF composites a pushed opacity as one layer, the
  same as the Mac transparency layer); the canvas preview must do the same.
- `windows/src/BetterScreenshot.Platform/SettingsStore.cs` — `EditorRecentColors`.
- `windows/src/BetterScreenshot.App/Resources/Icons.xaml` — existing keys cover the tools, `icon-undo`,
  `icon-redo`, `icon-bring-front`, `icon-send-back`, `icon-trash`, `icon-stack`, `icon-save`, `icon-copy`;
  **new icons needed:** eyedropper, info (hint line), panel toggle (sidebar-right), bold, italic,
  align-left / centre / right.
- Tests: `windows/tests/BetterScreenshot.Tests/` — recreate the cases in §1.6 (next to `EditorStyleTests.cs`).

### 1.8 Platform notes (Windows)

- **Modifier keys:** ⌘ → Ctrl throughout (Ctrl+= / Ctrl+− / Ctrl+0 / Ctrl+1, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y);
  ⌥⌘I → **Ctrl+Alt+I**. Tool keys must be ignored when the focused element is the text-editing `TextBox`
  (`e.OriginalSource is TextBox`).
- **Pinch:** precision touchpads deliver pinch to classic apps as **Ctrl + mouse wheel**, so handling
  `PreviewMouseWheel` with Ctrl covers both pinch and Ctrl+wheel; anchor on `e.GetPosition(stage)`. Plain
  wheel scrolls the `ScrollViewer`; Shift+wheel pans horizontally.
- **100%** = one image pixel per *physical* pixel: magnification = 1 / (monitor DPI ÷ 96)
  (`VisualTreeHelper.GetDpi(window).DpiScaleX`). Use `RenderOptions.BitmapScalingMode="NearestNeighbor"`
  on the image at ≥ 300%.
- **Colour well:** WPF has no built-in colour picker — use `System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog` (or a
  custom popup) behind a 44×24 swatch button; a dialog is one "session" → one Recent entry, one undo step.
- **Eyedropper:** no system sampler on Windows. Show a full-screen, top-most transparent overlay over a
  `Graphics.CopyFromScreen` snapshot with a small magnifier by the cursor; click takes the pixel, Esc cancels.
- **Opacity:** `DrawingContext.PushOpacity` (renderer) / `UIElement.Opacity` on the preview shapes and on the
  text-editing `TextBox`.

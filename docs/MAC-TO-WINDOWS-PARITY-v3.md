# macOS → Windows parity — the 2026-09 editor & recording work

**What this is.** The macOS app (this repo, `main`) gained features in September 2026 that the
Windows port does not have. This document tells whoever ports them **exactly** what was built —
layout, items, labels, behaviour, defaults, persisted data, and pure logic — so the Windows version
can match without reading Swift. It is the reverse of `docs/WINDOWS-TO-MAC-PARITY.md`.

**The Windows port.** C#/.NET 9 + WPF on the `windows-port` branch, under `windows/`. Start with
`windows/README-win.md`, `windows/docs/PROGRESS.md`, and the per-module ground-truth files
`windows/docs/port-reference/0N-*.md`. Its recording engine is **ffmpeg** (`ddagrab`/`gdigrab` video,
WASAPI loopback system audio, `dshow` microphone) with pause implemented as one ffmpeg segment per
active span, concatenated at the end (`windows/src/BetterScreenshot.App/Recording/RecordingEngine.cs`).

**Conventions.** Sizes are macOS points; treat 1 pt = 1 WPF device-independent pixel. "SF Symbol"
names are macOS icon names — map them to the port's icon set in
`windows/src/BetterScreenshot.App/Resources/Icons.xaml`. Quoted UI strings are verbatim and should be
copied exactly. The design rationale for Parts 0–6 is in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-betterscreenshot-editor-recording-v3-design.md`.

**Each section below covers:** Layout (exact) · Items & behaviour · Data (persisted keys, defaults,
legacy decoding) · Pure logic to port 1:1 (with the macOS test cases) · Where it goes in the port ·
Platform notes (where Windows must differ).
